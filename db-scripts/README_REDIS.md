# Local Redis Setup

To run and connect to redis locally run the script:

```bash
./local-redis-stack-startup.sh
```

This starts up both the Redis Stack server and RedisInsight. The embedded RedisInsight allows you
to easily visualize the redis data.

RedisInsight is available at http://localhost:8001
